JavaScript functional programming utilities

### Getting started

You can install __mercenary__ from npm:

```bash
npm install rw-mercenary
```

__mercenary__ is a convenience wrapper for
<a href="http://lodash.com/" target="_blank">__lodash__</a> and
<a href="http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/" target="_blank">__Q__</a> with some additional
features for functional programming and promise management. We use __mercenary__ in our
projects at
<a href="https://github.com/republicwireless-open" target="_blank">__Republic Wireless__</a>
to standardize the names and techniques we use in our functional programming.

If you'd like to use __mercenary__ in your projects, please view the source for
available features.
